# Voice Samples for TTS

This directory contains voice sample files used for text-to-speech synthesis and voice cloning experiments.

## Guidelines

- **Supported formats**: WAV, MP3, M4A, FLAC
- **Recommended quality**: 16-bit, 22kHz or higher  
- **Duration**: 10+ seconds for best quality
- **Content**: Clear, single-speaker recordings
- **Background**: Minimal noise, good recording quality

## Usage

Voice samples in this directory can be used to:
- Test different TTS voices
- Experiment with voice characteristics
- Compare synthesis quality across different speakers

## Best Practices

1. **Clean Audio**: Remove background noise and echoes
2. **Single Speaker**: One person speaking clearly
3. **Natural Speech**: Conversational tone works best
4. **Good Recording**: Use quality microphone when possible

## Future Enhancement

This directory is prepared for future voice cloning features that will allow the system to:
